# push_all.sh - Project-specific configuration for push_projects.sh
#
# This script defines the list of projects to process and sources the
# reusable push_projects.sh script from the workflows repo.
#
# Usage:
#   ./push_all.sh                              # Update deps and process only projects with changes
#   ./push_all.sh --force                      # Force version bump on all projects
#   ./push_all.sh --subpackages                # Also process sub-packages in /packages directories
#   ./push_all.sh --starting-project <name>    # Skip projects until reaching <name>
#   ./push_all.sh --help                       # Show help message

# Define projects in dependency order with wait times
# Format: "relative_path:wait_after_in_seconds"
#
# Wait times are used for packages that need CI/CD to complete publishing
# before dependent packages can fetch the new version from npm.
